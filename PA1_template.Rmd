# Title to be decided

## Loading and preprocessing the data

Let's load the data.

```{r}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

A quick peek of the data:

```{r}
head(activity)
summary(activity)
```

It looks like the data is already in a format suitable for analysis.

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

First let's calculate the total number of steps for each day.

```{r}
sapply(split(activity, activity$date), function(x) (sum(x[, 1])))
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
